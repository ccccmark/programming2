# Syllabus Unit 1

Welcome to the resume of the Unit 1 syllabus, in this file you will find some useful information about the first unit of the Programming subject.


**Programming paradigm**



*Declarative*

Functional programming focuses on functions. In a functional program, all the elements can be understood as functions and the code can be executed by means of sequential function calls. Conversely, values are not assigned independently. A function is best imagined as a special variant of a subprogram. This is reusable and, a procedural difference, directly returns a result.


*Dataflow*


In a control flow language, you have a stream of instructions which operate on external data. Conditional execution, jumps and procedure calls change the instruction stream to be executed. This could be seen as instructions flowing through data (for example, instructions operate on registers which are loaded with data by instructions



Some examples of dataflow features and languages:

1.Spreadsheets are essentially dataflow

2.Unix pipes

3.Futures and promises are dataflow or dataflow-like constructs found in many modern languages

4.The messaging in the actor model is dataflow
