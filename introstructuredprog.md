### Programming paradigm

Indicates a method of implementation computations and the way in which the tasks to be carried out by a program. They are also associated with a certain programming style, programming languages, and include various paradigms.
 

### Declarative

Functional programming focuses on functions. In a functional program, all the elements can be understood as functions and the code can be executed by means of sequential function calls. Conversely, values ​​are not assigned independently. A function is best imagined as a special variant of a subprogram. This is reusable and, a procedural difference, directly returns a result.


### Dataflow


In a control flow language, you have a stream of instructions which operate on external data. Conditional execution, jumps and procedure calls change the instruction stream to be executed. This could be seen as instructions flowing through data (for example, instructions operate on registers which are loaded with data by instructions


### Logic, Constraint-based

The facts and properties that specify the problem are specified. The
System uses that information to find the solution.

**_Logic programming_** studies the use of logic for problem solving and control over inference rules to achieve automatic solution.

Logical programming, together with functional programming, is part of what is known as **_Declarative Programming_**, that is, programming consists of indicating how to solve a problem by means of sentences. 

In Logical Programming, one works in a descriptive way, establishing relationships between entities, indicating not how, but what to do, then it is said that the essential idea of logic programming is.


### Imperative

Imperative programming describes sentences that change the state of a program. Imperative programming is considered natural programming for CPUs that use it at the most basic level.

### Structured

Structured programming, on the other hand, is a type of imperative programming, where declarations are put into procedures, which can be recalled when necessary. C uses procedural programming.

When programming in this way we specify a sequence of actions to be performed to show how a certain problem should be solved.

_Observation points can be set in the text of a routine and consider the values of the variables (state) when the flow of execution passes through these points. These values can change from one point to another and in the same point at times other than execution_

**Von Neumann**

#### Is any programming language that contains a high degree of abstraction and that is based on von Neumann architecture?
Many widely used programming languages, such as _C_, _C++_, and _Java_, are **no longer strictly von Neumann** by adding support for parallel processing, in the form of threads. However, most categorically non-Neumann-von languages **are also functional languages** and have not reached widespread use.


+ Interpreted (Scripting) 

+ Object-oriented(poo)

Object-oriented programming is a style that treats data as objects with attributes and methods that can be applied to these objects and also be inherited by other objects.

The _OOP_ focuses on classes and objects. When representing variables as objects, a function (method) can be passed to it. An object that belongs to a particular class can be treated independently. The OOP can be class based, which in this case objects **are based on predefined classes**. Prototype-based OOP also exists, so there is no need for classes and only objects are used.


### Data Representation

**Identifier**: Is a string of alphanumeric that begin with an alphabetic _char_ are used to represent varius programing element as arrays, function, structure, etc.

**Variable**: Value that change, depending on condition of information.

**Costant**: Value that cant be change.

**Reserved word**: Terms or phrases appropiated for special use.

**Primitive**: Are predefined data which supported by the programing languages.

**Compositive**: Values that are components as arrays, etc.

**Data type convertion**: Is a changing values from one data type storage format to another.

+ integer: Whole number _(8bits)_
+ char: A character variable _(1 byte)_
+ float: A fractional number _(16bits)_
+ long: A long integer _(8 bytes) (**-9223377203674738808** to **9223377203674738808**)_


### Operators

**Conditional**: Operators that is aexpression of returning two values is represent by "?"

**Logical**

_And_: represented by "&&"

_Or_: represented by "||"

_No_: represented by "!"

**Relationship**: Use to compare 2 variables

_Greather than_:= ">"

_less than_:="<"

_Equal to_: "=="

_Not equal to_:"!="


### Distributed version control (git)

Distributed version control system is a type of version control where the complete codebase, including its full version history.

Git is a open source distributed version control system tool designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 

Git has the functionality, performance, security and flexibility that most teams and individual developers need. It also serves as an important distributed version-control.


### What is Spaguetti code?
the spaghetti code is a poorly structured program code, overused with jumps (goto), twisted and tangled like a plate of spaghetti. Those programs that have been modified over the years by a multitude of different programmers tend to present this kind of convoluted structure. 

Spaghetti code is also known as difficult-to-maintain source code, and it has his own types of spaghetti code:

+ **Ravioli Code**: It describes code that comprises well-structured classes that are easy to understand in isolation, but difficult to understand as a whole.

+ **Lasangna Code**: Whose layers are so complicated and intertwined that making a change in one layer would necessitate changes in all other layers. Summarizing, if one layer is modified, all code need to be modified.


+ **Pizza Code**: Flat architecture code
